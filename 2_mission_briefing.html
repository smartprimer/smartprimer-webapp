                <h4><i> The History </i></h4>

                <p>For nearly one hundred years, the ancient <a onclick="question('Syracuse')">Syracuse</a> and <a onclick="question('Carthage')">Carthage</a> had been at war as ruler after ruler fought each other for the throne. Finally, in 275 BCE, the troops from Syracuse grew weary of the inefficiency and selfishness of their leaders and elected commanders from amongst themselves. One of their chosen leaders was a young general named <a onclick="question('Greek')">Greek</a> cities of Syracuse and Carthage had been at war as ruler after ruler fought each other for the throne. Finally, in 275 BCE, the troops from Syracuse grew weary of the inefficiency and selfishness of their leaders and elected commanders from amongst themselves. One of their chosen leaders was a young general named <a onclick="question('Hiero')">Hiero</a>.</p>

                <p>Now, Hiero was <a onclick="question('charismatic')">charismatic</a> and had a natural talent for leadership and politics. With his new status and help from his connections, he entered the city of Syracuse and managed to take over its government. And the citizens of Syracuse, who typically rejected the thought of soldiers picking their own leaders, made an exception and accepted Hiero as a leader. In 270 BCE, a great battle broke out, and it was Hiero who led Syracuse to victory, prompting the people of Syracuse chose Hiero as their king.</p>

                <p>The people of Ancient Greece believed in <a onclick="question('many gods')">many gods</a>, and Hiero was grateful to them all for his success and good fortune. To show his appreciation, Hiero decided to put into a temple a golden crown made in their honor. Hiero weighed out a precise amount of gold, and appointing a goldsmith, commanded him to fashion out of the gold a <a onclick="question('laurel wreath')">laurel wreath</a> shaped crown worthy of the gods.</p>

                <figure width=30% style=text-align:center;><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/Laurel-Wreath.png?alt=media&token=3a4ef84d-fdb2-4bde-ac3c-ef1cec4a14cf" width=30%/> </figure>

                <p>The goldsmith did as instructed, and several days later, he returned to the king with a beautiful and intricate crown in the form of a laurel wreath, just as the king had requested. This crown weighed exactly the same as the gold the king had given to the smith and King Hiero, pleased with the work, rewarded the goldsmith.</p>

                <p>King Hiero began preparations for the ceremony in which he would place the crown in the temple. But something has gone wrong. The king is <a onclick="question('furious')">furious</a>, the festival has been put on hold, and the city is in turmoil.</p>
