She quickly regained her balance and looked around to ensure that nobody noticed her sudden appearance, seemingly out of nowhere. But everyone’s attention was focused on an argument across the vast marketplace, where a <a onclick=\"question(\'fishmonger\')\">fishmonger</a> and a <a onclick=\"question(\'confectioner\')\">confectioner</a> were shouting at one another. <br> <br> \"He’s done it! I tell you,\" the <a onclick=\"question(\'crotchety\')\">crotchety</a> fishmonger shouted. \"He’s ruined the ceremony!\" <br> <br> Several of the onlookers shouted their agreement. John made her way over to the crowd. This argument was clearly related to her task and she thought she could, perhaps get more details so she might figure out exactly what she was to do. <br> <br> \"No, no. The goldsmith is innocent! He wouldn’t dare risk the wrath of the gods,\" the confectioner, with flour caught in his beard, replied in a gentler voice. There was a murmur of agreement with the crowd. Apparently nobody was certain one way or the other. <br> <br> \"How could you be so naïve? It was the money. The gold. He couldn’t resist the chance to steal some wealth for himself.\" <br> <br>The argument continued, until all of a sudden the entire agora went silent. A lone man walked across the agora and straight through the crowd. He didn’t say a word, but the group parted as he passed, giving him a wide berth as he passed. And when he had turned the corner, the cluster still gathered dispersed. The argument was over. <br> <br> John was left standing where the crowd had been just moments before when the fishmonger called out to her, \"Hey! Girl! What are you doing standing there? Looking to steal something?\" <br> <br>\"What? I…no. I’m just…,\" John had no real answer. She had a general goal—to stop the turmoil in Syracuse—but she had no idea where to start.<br> <br> \"You’re just what? I see what your doing. And I’m telling you, you try to steal my fish and I’ll have your hand,\" the fishmonger threatened. <br><br>\"You have no idea what you’re talking about. John here is my new assistant. She helps me keep inventory records. You know I’m bad with numbers,\" the confectioner said from behind the fishmonger, with a wink at John as he came up with a fake name. \"Come on John. I have some work for you.\" <br><br> <figure align = center><img src=https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/greece_welcome.gif?alt=media&token=583998b1-296e-4129-8623-1dcadd3e40bf width=30%/></figure><br> <br> John had no choice but to follow the confectioner. It certainly seemed like a better option than staying behind with the <a onclick=\"question(\'accusatory\')\">accusatory</a> fishmonger. Not to mention, the confectioner’s stand was sure to smell better. <br> <br>The confectioner returned to work, ignoring John idling right behind him. With nothing better to do, John asked, \"So what was that argument about?\"<br> <br>\"What are you still doing here?\" <br> <br>\"Well, I was hoping you could tell me more about the argument you were having with the fishmonger.\"<br> <br>\"And I was hoping my inventory records would magically do themselves. But sorry, kid. I can’t talk to you and do math at the same time. I was telling the truth when I said I was bad with numbers.\"<br> <br>\"Alright. Then how about this,\" John proposed. \"If you show me what to do, I’ll do your inventory for you, and when I’m done, you answer all my questions about the argument.\"<br> <br>The confectioner let out a <a onclick=\"question(\'guffaw\')\">guffaw</a>. \"You have yourself a deal….say, what’s your name.\"<br> <br>John answered.<br> <br>\"John. Weird name. Not a Greek one. Where’s it from? Well, guess that doesn’t matter. I’m Sosibios,\" the confectioner introduced himself.<br> <br>Sosibios continued, \"Alright John, I can keep track of most everything I sell in my head. But the sesame candies always sell fast and I can never keep track of how many I have. You see that box over there,\" the confectioner gestured to a large crate. \"It’s filled with sesame candies and I need to know how many there are. The number doesn’t have to be exact; a good approximation ’ll do. But if you count that real quick and let me know what’s left, I can tell you what I know about the crown, although I’m warning you, it isn’t much.\"<br> <br>Looking at the crate, John noticed it was about the size of a shoe box, and each cube-shaped candy had the width, height, and depth that was about the same as the diameter of a quarter. The crate was about half full. John decided that instead of counting the candies, he’d approximate how many could fit in the box.<br> <br><figure width=30% style=text-align:center;> <img src=https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/quarters.png?alt=media&token=e9b6a625-7c81-4c8f-9988-b8b2b0c2f335 width=30%/>   <figcaption>Cubic </figcaption>  </figure> <br> She first figured out how many candies could fit along the width of the box and how many could fit along the depth, if each candy has a width and depth about equal to the diameter of a quarter. <br> <br>She then multiplied these values together to determine how many candies it would take to create a single layer in the bottom of the box.<br> <br>But there are several layers of candy within the box, so John counted how many candies she would fit, one on top of another, in the height of the box, if each candy has a height about equal to the diameter of a quarter. This is the number of layers the box can hold. So she took the number of layers in the box she just found and multiplied this by the number of candies in a layer that she’d found before. This is the total number of candies the box could hold. <br> <br>But John remembered the box was only half full, so she divided the total number of candies the box could hold in two to estimate the number of candies remaining.<br> <br>John went to Sosibios and told him the answer.<br> <br>" ,

    Page2: "\"Oh wonderful,\" The confectioner exclaimed. \"You did that so quickly and accurately. If you ever need a job, let me know. But for now, you said you wanted me to answer questions for you?\"<br> <br> <figure width=30% style=text-align:center;><img src=https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/scroll-sticks.jpg?alt=media&token=20b64998-7854-40c7-bc3d-32035c6123e1 width=30%/> </figure><br><br>\"I’m new to the city. Just got here,\" John explained, although she—obviously—just got there from a different time in addition to a different place. \"There seems to be a lot of <a onclick=\"question(\'uproar\')\">uproar</a> around here. Is it always like this?\"<br> <br>\"No, no. Of course not! It’s because of the festival. King Hiero has decided to hold a ceremony honoring the gods. And the most important part is the crown he will place in the temple. But rumors are <a onclick=\"question(\'astir\')\">astir</a> that the goldsmith in charge of the crown stole some of the gold for himself and replaced it with a <a onclick=\"question(\'lesser\')\">lesser</a> metal. And if that’s true the king will need to cancel everything. You can’t give an impure crown to the gods, you know.\"<br> <br>\"Of course you can’t. And who was it that passed through and made everyone quiet?\" John inquired further.<br> <br>\"That was the king’s cousin, Archimedes. He’s a genius. Does hard math all the time and makes new inventions practically every week. You should see what he comes up with. I wouldn’t be surprised if the king has asked him to help get to the bottom of the gold fiasco. If anyone could help, he could.\"<br> <br>Hmmm. Archimedes could be a good person to find, John thought. \"Where can I find him? I’d love to meet him.\"<br> <br>\"You see that road there?\" Sosibios pointed toward the closest corner of the agora, where Archimedes had disappeared some time before. <br> <br>John nodded.<br> <br>\"Go out that exit and follow the road straight for four minutes or so. When you get to the bath houses, turn right. He lives on the next corner. Trust me; you can’t miss it.\"<br> <br>John thanked Sosibios for his help and hurried off in the direction the confectioner had indicated.<br> <br>",

    Page3: "The building was broken down where the others on the street seemed brand new. The <a onclick=\"question(\'facade\')\">façade</a> was chipping, the window shutters were tilted and the door hung <a onclick=\"question(\'ajar\')\">ajar</a>. Planks of wood and blocks of stone sat outside the door, waiting for a moment they would be put into use. And very distinct noises came from inside: shuffling and banging, as if a giant wandered the inside and every time he took a step, another item in the building was bounced off its shelf. Sosibios was right; you really couldn’t miss it.<br> <br>But nobody else on the street seemed to take any notice. Apparently the disarray and discontinuity of Archimedes’ home was a well-known sight. John made her way up to the front door and peered inside.<br> <br><figure align = center><img src=https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/home-greece.png?alt=media&token=dcbab5f5-d7d3-4e48-b199-2a753b700b85 width=30%/></figure><br> <br>\"Hello?\" she called out.  There was no answer. \"Helloooo?\"<br> <br>Still no response. John was about to try again when she heard, \"I need more time than that. You expect me to find you an answer in 2 hours? Psh. Ridiculous!\"The voice was slowly moving toward her, and soon enough a man emerged from the dim light of the room. <br> <br>\"Oh! I’m so sorry! I thought you were my fool of a cousin.\"<br> <br>\"Sorry?\" John said, confused, before connecting the dots. \"Oh! You mean the king!? No, I’m definitely not him.\"<br> <br>\"Well I can see that, obviously. But who are you?\"<br> <br>John shared her name and explained that she wished to learn more about the crown.<br> <br>\"Well, come in then. Take a seat somewhere.\"<br> <br>John tentatively followed the <a onclick=\"question(\'frazzled\')\">frazzled</a> man into his home, picking her way through stacks of paper and pieces of wood, stone, and metal. As she stepped around a corner, she accidently brushed a plank of wood off a table. It clattered to the floor and John let out an apology. Now she knew the source of the noises she heard outside.<br> <br>A barefoot Archimedes perched himself cross-legged on a stool and gestured toward another. John took a seat.<br> <br>\"Now why don’t you tell me a bit more about you, John. You can start with those funny clothes of yours.\"<br> <br>It took John a moment to figure out a reasonable response, \"Well...I’m  not from around here. Where I’m from, far to the west of here, these clothes are quite normal.\" She was, after all, from far to the West of Greece. Further, even, than had been explored in that time.<br> <br>\"Hmmm,\" Archimedes pondered, before he gave a nod, as if deciding not to pursue that line of questioning further. \"Alright, and what made you decide to come asking about the crown?\"<br> <br>\"It’s true that I’m a visitor, but I’d heard how friendly the people of this city were. When I got here, everyone seemed to be upset and the city was in turmoil. I figure I only have a short time here, so I might as well use that time in a way that returns the city to its normal welcoming ways. I know it’s odd that someone who isn’t from here would taken on the problem, but I really do want to help if I can.\"<br> <br>\"Alright, alright. Well here’s what happened. The king decided to hold a ceremony honoring the gods for his successes and luck. So he commissioned the goldsmith to make a crown to give as an offering. He carefully weighed out gold and gave it to the smith and a few days later, sure enough, he received a crown of the exact some weight, so assumed it was legitimate. The fool he is! Everyone knows the smith overcharges! Why would he treat the king any better? A crook is a crook.<br> <br>\"So know there are rumors spreading that the smith switched out a part of the gold for an equal weight of silver, and my fool of a cousin wants me to determine if that’s true. Without ruining the crown, no less! Ridiculous!\"<br> <br>\"So what are you going to do?\" John asked in captivated curiosity.<br> <br><figure align = center><img src=https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/archimedes-puzzle.jpg?alt=media&token=26bd21a1-db2f-43a6-8789-2c2a9985ce53 width=50%/> </figure><br> <br>\"Well, I have some ideas, but don’t know if they’ll work. Say, do you want to help? I could use an assistant if you prove yourself capable.\"<br> <br>John hesitated. Prove herself capable? Her mission was to stop the uproar in the city. But then she realized that if she could get to the bottom of this mystery with the goldsmith and determine the facts, she might be able to help. John heartily agreed to assist Archimedes.<br> <br>\"Wonderful!\" the man exclaimed. \"I have an idea, but I need someone with some brains to help. Do you think you’re up to it? Way back when, I went to school with a man named Aristippus, a very dear friend of mine, but I guess you could say we never quite got over our boyhood rivalry. Every once in awhile, he’ll send me a puzzle challenge. I got another one from him just yesterday,  and I’d like you to solve it. Here’s what he’s given me:<br> <br>" ,

    Page11:"John carried the proposal over to the bathhouse and handed it to Archimedes. Archimedes leapt from his bath and, without stopping to get dressed, ran out the building and down the street.<br> <br><figure width=30% style=text-align:center;><img src=https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/archimedes-eureka.jpg?alt=media&token=69ca8c4c-9cc9-478d-931d-bcfaa1564546 width=30%/> </figure><br> <br>\"Eureka!,\" John heard, over and over. \"I found it!\" <br> <br>John ran after the voice, and very quickly found out where the naked man was headed. Straight to the palace! John, at least, had the forethought to stop by Archimedes’s house and grab him a <a onclick=\"question(\'toga\')\">toga</a> before <a onclick=\"question(\'sprinting\')\">sprinting</a> to catch up.<br> <br>John’s speed helped her arrive at the palace at the same time as Archimedes. Archimedes grabbed the toga from her without a word, as if it was understood all along that John would stop by the house to grab it.<br> <br>Archimedes was let in to see his cousin, the king, immediately, and was still putting his clothes on when he walked into the room where King Hiero was sitting.<br> <br>\"Hello, Archimedes. And who is this?\" The king gestured at John.<br> <br>\"This is John. She assisted me in my experiments and helped me find a way to test your crown.\"<br> <br>\"Oh wonderful!\" The king exclaimed with glee, a smile crossing his face for the first time since John laid eyes on him. He continued, \"Now the people of Syracuse can stop their <a onclick=\"question(\'bickering\')\">bickering</a>. And what more, I have decided the festival will go on, crown or no.\"<br> <br>The voices faded as the crown was dropped into a tub of water. And soon other the other noises of ancient Greece begin fading as well, replaced once again with the sounds of your living room. \"It’s fake!\" were the last words you heard before Greece was left behind entirely.<br> <br>"

Ridiculous!\"<br> <br>\"So what are you going to do?\" John asked in captivated curiosity.<br> <br><figure align = center><img src=https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/archimedes-puzzle.jpg?alt=media&token=26bd21a1-db2f-43a6-8789-2c2a9985ce53 width=50%/> </figure><br> <br>\"Well, I have some ideas, but don’t know if they’ll work. Say, do you want to help? I could use an assistant if you prove yourself capable.\"<br> <br>John hesitated. Prove himself capable? His mission was to stop the uproar in the city. But then he realized that if he could get to the bottom of this mystery with the goldsmith and determine the facts, he might be able to help. John heartily agreed to assist Archimedes.<br> <br>\"Wonderful!\" the man exclaimed. \"I have an idea, but I need someone with some brains to help. Do you think you’re up to it? Way back when, I went to school with a man named Aristippus, a very dear friend of mine, but I guess you could say we never quite got over our boyhood rivalry. Every once in awhile, he’ll send me a puzzle challenge. I got another one from him just yesterday,  and I’d like you to solve it. Here’s what he’s given me:<br> <br>" ,

Archimedes leapt from his bath and, without stopping to get dressed, ran out the building and down the street.<br> <br><figure style=text-align:center;><img src=https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/smartprimer-e0b94.appspot.com/o/archimedes-eureka.jpg?alt=media&token=69ca8c4c-9cc9-478d-931d-bcfaa1564546 width=90%/> </figure> <br> <br>\"Eureka!,\" John heard, over and over. \"I found it!\" <br> <br>John ran after the voice, and very quickly found out where the naked man was headed. Straight to the palace! John, at least, had the forethought to stop by Archimedes’s house and grab him a <a onclick=\"question(\'toga\')\">toga</a> before <a onclick=\"question(\'sprinting\')\">sprinting</a> to catch up.<br> <br>John’s speed helped him arrive at the palace at the same time as Archimedes. Archimedes grabbed the toga from him without a word, as if it was understood all along that John would stop by the house to grab it.<br> <br>Archimedes was let in to see his cousin, the king, immediately, and was still putting his clothes on when he walked into the room where King Hiero was sitting.<br> <br>\"Hello, Archimedes. And who is this?\" The king gestured at John.<br> <br>\"This is John. He assisted me in my experiments and helped me find a way to test your crown.\"<br> <br>\"Oh wonderful!\" The king exclaimed with glee, a smile crossing his face for the first time since John laid eyes on him. He continued, \"Now the people of Syracuse can stop their <a onclick=\"question(\'bickering\')\">bickering</a>. And what more, I have decided the festival will go on, crown or no.\"<br> <br>The voices faded as the crown was dropped into a tub of water. And soon other the other noises of ancient Greece begin fading as well, replaced once again with the sounds of your living room. \"It’s fake!\" were the last words you heard before Greece was left behind entirely.<br> <br>"
